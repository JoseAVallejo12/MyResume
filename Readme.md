# 0x06. Personal Website

## You, Online

An employer who is trying to evaluate you for their team needs to be able to get to know you online, fast! They may find you any number of ways. Maybe you tweeted at them, and they followed your Twitter profile link. Maybe you submitted your resume and they liked what they saw enough to do a google search.

Wherever they begin their journey, you want to create a clear path for them to continue getting to know you and ideally you want to have enough content to continue to keep them engaged.

For creating your website, you can use whatever tools you want - and use an existing template. You can find some of them here:

## Tasks

### 0. Get a domain name

Your domain name should follow these general guidelines:

- Ideally based off your name
- Professional: This means no controversial words embedded (religious, political). Adding words like “dev” or “eng” are great!
- Shorter names are better than longer names
- Either free or very low cost is best
Buying a domain name is not the same as having dedicated web hosting. You can host your page on GitHub pages and have the unique subdomain myname.github.io. If you want to additionally have a shorter more personalized domain name, you can register myname.dev to point to your myname.github.io page. Totally up to you. This task is purely to ensure that you have a link.

There are sites that will host a landing page for free, and provide a custom subdomain.

- [GitHub pages](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/lkTUOSyd5jE684jEmAnegQ)
- [Wordpress](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/zeDbnHJvji-RwDkmgMk-jw)
These are places where you can register your domain name (without any site hosting):

- [Go Daddy](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/fylWEH59cakG0zWUJwhh2g)
- [Google Domains](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/xwCiwSsaZLzJSIkdQ1jSZw)
And there are options with more bells & whistles to provide paid web hosting: (note: usually the pricing includes one domain name)

- [Squarespace](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/D_HfSM9PaKveYzYlk0xccA)
- [Webfaction](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/v-R0eyDYchmeUoqU-xVEtA)

#### [see demo here](https://joseavallejo12.github.io/MyResume/)

### 1. Add an About Me section

Optional, but recommended: Include a professional, representative, and well-lit photo.

**Required:** Add a paragraph to describe yourself. This should come from the “Building a narrative” project. It’s the text that you want to echo over-and-over online to provide a consistent message of who you are. Link to companies or projects that you refer to.

Some examples I like:

### 2.Add a portfolio section

Your portfolio should showcase the projects you’ve listed on your resume.

For each project: 1. Feature a screenshot 2. Add a description 3. Link to the GitHub README.md 4. Link to the deployed app (if applicable)

These are some great examples of portfolios:

- [Sergii Garkusha](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/nk_R1H5QvEz4xDDXlOz3xw)
- [Nga La](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sQ3fNkKSuF6wEis9rdeSNQ)
